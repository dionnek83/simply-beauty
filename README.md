# Simply Beauty Ecommerce website 

This project was created with PHP, SQL and React and I designed the website using Figma.

## Product page

This page displays all the hair lengths available. Once you select a length you can then select how many items they would like to purchase. It should be noted that the user can only add the item to the cart once a hair length and the quantity has been selected (by default one item is selected) by clicking on the cart button and the user will be notified that the item has been added to the cart.

At the bottom of the page related products are displayed.

## Cart
The cart displays all the items that were added to the cart and here users are able to:
- Remove an item.
- Update the quantity of each item.
  
On the right side of the page an order summary is displayed which totals the items in the cart. If there are no items in the cart the "Your cart is empty" is displayed. The start shopping button directs the user to the "Shop All" page
